# Asteroids

This is an Asteroids clone written in Elixir with Nerves, more for fun and
learning than for anything else. Also since the code (and behavior) is
relatively simple, I hope that it can serve as an example for Scenic, Nerves,
and as a simple [poncho
project](https://embedded-elixir.com/post/2017-05-19-poncho-projects/).

TODO:
* [x] Get basic nerves install working on network
* [x] Run scenic play application on nerves!
